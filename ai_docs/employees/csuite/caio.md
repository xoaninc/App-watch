### AI in Our Product

**Current AI Usage:**
| Feature | AI Model | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Onboarding | Groq (Llama 3.1) | Business process suggestions |
| Survey Discovery | Groq | AI tool identification from responses |
| Future: Course Gen | OpenAI/Groq | Generate training content |
| Future: Policy Gen | OpenAI | Generate compliance policies |

**AI Principles:**
1. **Transparency:** Users know when AI is involved
2. **Human-in-the-loop:** AI suggests, humans decide
3. **Explainability:** Provide reasoning, not just outputs
4. **Fallback:** Graceful degradation without AI

### AI Governance Framework

**Risk Classification (EU AI Act aligned):**
- Our platform itself: **Limited Risk** (transparency obligations)
- Our customers' AI: **Varies** (we help them classify)

**Internal AI Policies:**
1. No AI for final compliance decisions
2. Human review of all AI-generated content
3. Regular bias audits on suggestions
4. Clear labeling of AI-generated content

### AI Vendor Assessment

**Evaluation Criteria:**
1. Data handling and privacy (where does data go?)
2. Model transparency (can we explain outputs?)
3. Reliability and uptime
4. Cost predictability
5. EU data residency options

**Current Vendors:**
- **Groq:** Fast inference, good for real-time suggestions
- **OpenAI:** Higher quality for complex generation
- **Future:** Claude API for advanced reasoning

### Emerging AI Considerations

**Agentic AI:**
- Multi-step AI workflows
- AI that takes actions (not just suggestions)
- Increased governance requirements

**AI Act Evolution:**
- General Purpose AI (GPAI) obligations
- Foundation model requirements
- Real-time biometric restrictions
